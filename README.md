Simple app for people who likes to organize parties, and buys stuff together, and then want to know who owes whom, and how much, and so on. Here is when this app comes in handy :)

Simple use case
---------------

Say, there are three friends (Alex, Brian and Carl), each having a girlfriend, too. They gather to celebrate something. Celebrating without some alcohol is boring, so they go to supermarket and put to the cart:

 * Bottle of champaign. Because they like to make toasts. Costs 200 (virtual units - VU).
 * Becherovka. A herbal bitter. All guys like it, and only Carl's girlfriend likes it. 220 VU.
 * Whiskey. Men will drink whiskey while girls will be discussing their girl-ish stuff. 600 VU.
 * Kahlua. Sweet liquor that Carl's girl demanded exclusively. 170 VU.

All together costs 1190 VU.

Having all listed above they proceed to checkout, where it appears that only Carl has enough cash and also Alex has enough to pay for champaign. Alex gives 200 VU, Carl gives the remaining amount - 990 VU.

After the party is over they want to know how to distribute their expences proportionally to consumed volumes, so they take the app, input the above data and get these results:

```
Brian owes 66,67 to Alex
Alex owes 188,33 to Carl
Brian owes 255,00 to Carl
```
